# Forest
## Overview
Welcome to the Earthshot Labs repository for above-ground biomass estimation, called `forest`, for want of a more clever name.

The goal of this repository is to streamline collaboration between team members and especially to enable productive collaboration or brainstorming in between our regular team meetings. Our team is also active on Google Earth Engine in the `/users/tsongkapa/earthshot/Forest` workspace.

## Contributing Ideas
In an effort to help track work across a group of distributed contributors, this repository contains a [project](https://github.com/earthshot-labs/forest/projects/1) tracking towards the above-ground biomass (AGB) minimum viable product (MVP). Our goal is to work towards this first version of an AGB product, but suggested avenues for related future work are always welcome.

If anyone has a dataset, approach, or any other idea that might be of interest to the team, they should feel free to bring it up at a team meeting and/or to [file a Github Issue](https://github.com/earthshot-labs/forest/issues/new/choose). The goal of tracking ideas in Issues is to help organize the team's thoughts, preserve a record of our thought processes and assumptions, and to allow everyone to contribute, even those who cannot regularly make meetings or who come up with their best ideas offline. Feel free to view or search existing Issues [here](https://github.com/earthshot-labs/forest/issues).

When in doubt, please err on the side of submitting an Issue or bringing up an idea. This is a project made up of contributors from a wide variety of backgrounds, and just because something seems obvious to you doesn't necessarily mean it's occurred to the rest of the team.

## Contributing Code
When contributing code to this repository, please avoid committing directly to the main branch. Instead, contributors should create a new branch containing their changes and submit a new [Pull Request](https://github.com/earthshot-labs/forest/compare) for that branch.

We understand that folks will have different levels of comfort with large, collaborative projects on Github, so please do not hesitate to ask if any of this is unclear or unfamiliar. (Feel free to direct message @connor on Slack with any and all questions; I promise to help!)
