# GEDI
This folder is intended for code relating to data from the [GEDI](https://gedi.umd.edu/) mission. The Level 1B, Level 2A, and Level 2B data from GEDI are of particular interest for our work here.

Currently, we are using the rGEDI package (see: [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/rGEDI/index.html), [tutorial](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/rGEDI/vignettes/tutorial.html), [paper](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/339971349_rGEDI_An_R_Package_for_NASA%27s_Global_Ecosystem_Dynamics_Investigation_GEDI_Data_Visualizing_and_Processing), [source](https://github.com/carlos-alberto-silva/rGEDI)) to download and process the data from GEDI. As a result, a considerable amount of code here will likely be in R.
