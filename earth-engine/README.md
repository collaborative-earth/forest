# Google Earth Engine
This folder is intended for various scripts or code snippets from Google Earth Engine.

A considerable amount of JavaScript code lives in the `/users/tsongkapa/earthshot/Forest` workspace on Earth Engine. In addition to that, this folder is a good place for any python implementations of Earth Engine code, utility code to format or upload assets to Earth Engine, etc.
